# Dental-Disease-Detection-using-Yolo-Algorithm
This project focuses on detecting common dental problems—such as cavities, fillings, and implants—using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm applied to radiographic (X-ray) images. Leveraging YOLO’s real-time object detection capabilities, the model is trained on annotated dental X-rays formatted in YOLO's structure, where each dental issue is marked with bounding boxes and class labels. The pipeline includes preprocessing of X-ray images, model training using YOLOv5 or YOLOv8, and inference to output labeled images highlighting detected dental conditions. The goal is to assist dental diagnostics by automating the identification of issues like caries, restorations, and prosthetics, with potential expansion to cover more complex conditions in future iterations.
